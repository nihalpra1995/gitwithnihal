 IMPORTANT: This sample is provided AS-IS with no warranties and confers no rights.

 This sample is intended only for Federation Server farms. If your AD FS 2.x deployment type is Standalone,
 this sample does not apply to your Federation Service.

 The following changes will occur as a result of executing this sample:
	1. The AD FS service will be stopped
	2. The AD FS database permissions will be altered to allow access for the new account
	3. A servicePrincipalName registration will be removed from the old account and registered to the new account
	4. The AD FS service and AdfsAppPool identity will be changed to the new account
	5. Certificate private key permissions will be modified to allow access for the new account
	6. The new account will be allowed user rights: "Log on as a service" and "Generate security audits"

 PRE-EXECUTION TASKS
 1. Create the new service account in Active Directory
 2. Install SQLCmd.exe on each Federation Server in the farm
	SQLCmd.exe requires the SQL Native Client to be installed
	After SQLCmd.exe has been installed, all Powershell windows must be
	closed and re-opened to continue with execution of this sample.

	Download both installers from the following location:
	http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15748

 If you are ready to proceed, type capital C and press Enter to continue: C

 Note: The sample must be executed against each Federation Server in the farm.
 Windows Internal Database (WID) and SQL farms are supported. Before execution can
 begin, an operating mode must be selected. Careful consideration of the following
 guidance is necessary to ensure the sample is executed properly on each server.

 GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING AN OPERATING MODE:

 WID FARM:
 The sample must be executed on all Secondary servers before execution should
 occur on the Primary server. The Primary server is the only server with Write access to the
 configuration database. The Primary server must be used as the 'Final Federation Server'

 Powershell command to determine whether a server is Primary or Secondary:
	Import-Module ADFS
	Get-AdfsSyncProperties

 SQL FARM:
 Any one server in the farm should be selected as the 'Final Federation Server'.
 All servers in a SQL farm have Write access to the configuration database. Execute the sample on all other
 servers in the farm before executing the sample on the server selected as the 'Final Federation Server'

 Select operating mode:
	1 - Federation Server
	2 - Final Federation Server
	Selection: 2
	Operating mode: Final Federation Server

 POST-SAMPLE ITEMS THAT MUST BE EXECUTED MANUALLY


 1. You must manually set User Rights Assigment for LEXAR\GMSA_AD$
    to allow "Generate Security Audits" and "Log On As a Service".

    Steps:
    Start -> Run -> GPEdit.msc -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings ->
    Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment


 2. SQLCmd.exe was not found on this system. The SQL scripts must be executed
    manually using either SQL Management Studio or SQLCmd.exe. The scripts currently reside
    in C:\Users\nihal\AppData\Local\Temp\ADFSSQLScripts.

    Syntax:
    sqlcmd.exe -S np:\\.\pipe\microsoft##wid\tsql\query -i C:\Users\nihal\AppData\Local\Temp\ADFSSQLScripts\SetPermissions.sql
    -o C:\Users\nihal\AppData\Local\Temp\ADFSSQLScripts\SetPermissions-output.log

    sqlcmd.exe -S np:\\.\pipe\microsoft##wid\tsql\query -i C:\Users\nihal\AppData\Local\Temp\ADFSSQLScripts\UpdateServiceSettings.sql
    -o C:\Users\nihal\AppData\Local\Temp\ADFSSQLScripts\UpdateServiceSettings-output.log


 3. Service start was skipped during execution due to post-sample needs. The service must be manually started.

    Syntax:
    net start adfssrv


 It is recommended the old service account LEXAR\LEXARADFS be deletd once the service account has been changed on all servers.
